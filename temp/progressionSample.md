The left kidney contains three stones, approximately 6 mm in the upper pole and two smaller stones around 4 mm in the mid and lower poles. The right kidney also contains three stones, with a similar distribution and approximate sizes (one 6 mm stone in the upper pole and two 4 mm stones in the mid and lower poles).'

  general_analysis: 'Two small, hyperdense lesions consistent with kidney stones are observed, one in the right kidney and one in the left kidney. No significant hydronephrosis is evident on this single axial image. Linear hyperdensities in the subcutaneous fat are noted bilaterally, likely representing surgical clips or artifacts, not kidney stones.'
